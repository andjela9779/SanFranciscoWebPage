                                <p> Called one of the seven wonders of the world, the Golden Gate Bridge is San Francisco’s best known landmark. Everyone can recognize its magnificent span of orange steel from its appearance in numerous movies and TV shows. When it was completed in 1937,<a id="ggpark"></a> its two 746 foot towers that anchor the bridge’s single-suspension were the tallest buildings in San Francisco. The suspended road is supported by two 7,000 foot cables.
                                    The engineering marvel was completed in spite of increasing opposition and it now connects San Francisco with the Marin County communities. Pedestrians and bikers are allowed on the sidewalks of the bridge but skateboards, roller blades and roller skates are not. On both sides of the bridge there are vista points with spectacular views and excellent photo opportunities. </p>

                                <p> Golden Gate Park, home to gardens and museums, is a fabulous green space in the heart of San Francisco, often considered the "lungs" of the city. Before development began in 1871, this was an area of arid dunes. Today, the park has a network of walking trails and cycling paths, more than 5,000 different kinds of plants and dozens of species of trees, several lakes, bridle paths, and a buffalo paddock. The main attractions include the de Young Museum, the California Academy of <a id="fishermans"></a>Sciences Museum with Steinhart Aquarium, the Japanese Tea Garden, and the San Francisco Botanical Garden.
                                    Golden Gate Park is one of those places that can just as easily take up a couple of hours as a couple of days. Bike rentals are available, and this can be a good way to explore the park, rather than trying to do everything on foot. Alternatively, try an organized Segway Tour with a local guide and hit all the major highlights. Even if you live in San Francisco, you are going to be discovering new wonderful spots in the park all the time. </p>
                                <span class="fishermans-wharf">Fishermans Wharf</span>
                                <p> Fisherman's Wharf is one of San Francisco's most popular tourist areas. If this is your first visit to the city and you only have a day or two to see the sights, Fisherman's Wharf is one of the best places to visit. This old section, once the Little Italy of San Francisco, is known for its shops, restaurants, and beautiful setting along the waterfront. It's a fun place to stroll around and get a taste for the city. From here, you can also take a sightseeing cruise for spectacular views of the city, or organize a fishing charter.
                                    Some of the main attractions in the area are Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, Musée Mécanique, Ripley's Believe it or Not!, and Ghirardelli Square. <a id="alcatraz"></a>Restored 19th- and 20th-century ships line the waterfront at the Hyde Street Pier, which is now the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park. The USS Pampanito, a national historic landmark, is a WWII submarine and part of the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park. Pier 39, located in this general area, is home to more than 130 stores and unique places to eat. It also offers great views looking back onto the city. </p>

                                    </div>
                                <p> Before becoming home of the infamous penitentiary, Alcatraz Island was the site of the country’s first lighthouse, offering the most magnificent views of the San Francisco skyline, as well as the first American-built fort on the entire West Coast. It also serves as the home of a large bird colony, and features gardens and tide pools.
                                    Today, the main reason why thousands of visitors take a scenic ferry ride across to the <a id="alamo"></a> Alcatraz island is the infamous Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, a maximum high-security federal prison that operated from 1934 to 1963. Off-limits to the public for many years, the abandoned prison fires the imagination, which is mostly fueled by numerous movies and stories of notorious criminals who spent their years on the Rock. The prison was home to 1,576 of America's most dangerous criminals, Al Capone being one of them. </p>
                                <span class="alamo-square">Alamo Square</span>
                                <p> Alamo Square is a park and neighborhood in San Francisco, California. The highly coveted residential neighborhood covers four city blocks located at the top of a hill, overlooking downtown San Francisco.<a id="cable"></a> It is famous for a number of substantial mansions and architecturally distinctive houses, such as a row of colorful Victorian houses bordering the park known as the "Painted Ladies.” Alamo Square Park has a tennis court and a kids’ playground and is a popular hangout of local residents, tourists and dog walkers. The view from the park on a clear day is spectacular and it is possible to see San Francisco City Hall, the Transamerica Pyramid building and even the tops of the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
                                <span class="cable-cars">Ride the Cable Cars</span>
                                <p> Cable Cars were introduced in 1873 to help locals contend with the many hills the city is built on. Today, the few remaining cable cars offer tourists a great way to explore the city in historic fashion. Since 1964, these tram-like vehicles have had the unique distinction of being the only public transport system to be declared a historic monument.
                                   The Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde are the most scenic routes. The cable cars will also get you to the major tourist attractions such as Fisherman's Wharf, Ghirardelli Square, the<a id="legion"></a> Ferry Building, Nob Hill, and Lombard Street. If you are planning on more than a couple of rides or are going to be sightseeing for a few days, you should consider buying a pass.

                                <p> An impressive Neoclassical Beaux-Arts building in an amazing setting, the California Palace of the Legion of Honor is San Francisco's most exquisite museum. The Legion of Honor was the gift of the socialite, philanthropist, and patron of the arts Alma de Bretteville Spreckels. Because of her love for all things Parisian, the museum was designed as a replica of the Palais de la Légion d'Honneur in Paris.
                                    The Legion of Honor museum has a superb collection of European decorative arts, sculpture, and paintings, along with antiquities from the Mediterranean and Near East. Admission to this museum also gives you same-day admission to the de Young Museum.
                                    The museum is in Lincoln Park, a gorgeous green space with a golf course and coastal woodlands and a wonderful place for a leisurely walk. Just outside the museum, visitors may follow the path along Lincoln Highway, which boasts <a id="att"></a>spectacular ocean vistas and perfect outlooks onto the Golden Gate Bridge. Those seeking a more adventurous hike can head to the Land's End Trail. This winding cliffside trail in a wild, rugged terrain offers sweeping Pacific Ocean views and panoramas of the Golden Gate Bridge.

                                <p> Home of the San Francisco Giants, AT&T park is a fun place to take in a baseball game while visiting the city. If you aren't able to see a game, consider taking a ballpark tour for a behind-the-scenes look at places off limits to most people. You can learn about the historic moments that have taken place here and explore the architecture. Tours are scheduled around games and do not run every day so check<a id="aqua"></a> the online calendar in advance.

And don't forget the playful river otters; the Aquarium's exhibit showcases conservation efforts to restore their population within the Bay Area.</p>
